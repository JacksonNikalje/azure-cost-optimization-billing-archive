Tiered Storage Strategy
Split the Cosmos DB records into:

Hot Data: Recent records (‚â§ 3 months) stored in Cosmos DB (read-heavy, low-latency).

Cold Data: Older records (> 3 months) archived in Azure Blob Storage as JSON/CSV (much cheaper).

üß© Components Involved
Component	Purpose
Azure Cosmos DB	Stores hot billing records (‚â§ 3 months).
Azure Blob Storage	Stores cold billing records (> 3 months) in compressed form.
Azure Function (Read)	Checks Cosmos DB first; if not found, reads from Blob Storage.
Azure Function (Move)	Moves old records from Cosmos DB to Blob Storage periodically.
Durable Functions	Optionally coordinate large-scale migrations reliably.
Timer Trigger	Triggers daily/weekly archiving jobs.

‚úÖ How This Meets Your Requirements
Requirement	How it's Addressed
Cost Optimization	Move large, infrequently accessed data to Blob Storage, reducing Cosmos DB RU & storage cost.
Simplicity	Uses native Azure serverless tools (Functions, Blob, Timer) ‚Äì minimal operational overhead.
No Data Loss	All records moved, not deleted, with verifiable write to Blob before deletion.
No Downtime	Async background archiving; APIs stay up throughout.
No API Changes	Add internal logic in existing function to read from Blob if Cosmos query fails.
Access Time (Seconds)	Blob Storage retrieval (especially if indexed by partition) easily achieves <3s.

üöÄ Implementation Steps
1. Create Cold Storage in Blob
Create a container (e.g., cold-billing-records).

Use folder structure: yyyy/mm/dd/recordID.json.

2. Modify Read Logic (Function App / API)
python
Copy
Edit
def get_billing_record(record_id):
    # 1. Try Cosmos DB
    record = cosmos_query(record_id)
    if record:
        return record

    # 2. Fallback to Blob
    blob_path = find_blob_path(record_id)  # Based on ID or metadata
    return read_blob_record(blob_path)
You keep the API unchanged; logic is internal.

3. Archival Function (Timer Trigger)
Runs daily or weekly.

Queries Cosmos DB for records > 3 months old.

Writes them to Blob.

On successful write, deletes from Cosmos DB.

4. Bulk Migration (One-Time Cleanup)
Use Durable Function to batch-move historical data to cold storage.

Log progress for verification.

5. Optional: Index or Metadata File
Maintain a lightweight index (index.json) in Blob for fast lookup.

Or derive blob paths from billing record ID hash/timestamp.

üí∏ Cost Benefits
Item	Estimated Impact
Cosmos DB RU reduction	Massive decrease since 75% of data is cold and can be archived.
Cosmos DB storage	Storage cost drops significantly for large documents.
Blob storage	~90% cheaper per GB vs Cosmos DB, especially with cool/archive tiers.
Functions	Inexpensive (serverless, billed per use).

üîê Security & Compliance
Ensure Blob Storage is private with RBAC or SAS token-based access.

Use Soft Delete / Immutable Blob Policy if required for audit.

Consider encryption-at-rest and logging via Azure Monitor.

üìä Monitoring & Alerts
Set alerts for Function failures.

Monitor Cosmos RU usage before & after rollout.

Set logs to confirm every record moved is checksum-verified.

üß™ Testing Plan
Run on a sample partition and validate:

Read logic correctly falls back to Blob.

Records are not lost.

Performance is acceptable.

Rollout gradually using feature flags or progressive partition targeting.
